  with the file format expected by the `--custom` argument of Chameleon

## Instructions for the Reproducibility Challenge

The Reproducibility Challenge is based on the SC22 paper [Symmetric Block-Cyclic Distribution: Fewer
Communications Leads to Faster Dense Cholesky
Factorization](https://inria.hal.science/hal-03768910/file/final_version_no_copyright.pdf).

The goal of the challenge is to reproduce results from this paper. The challenge will be evaluated
based on a written report, limited to **6 pages**, that should be handed to the SCC committee at the end
of the competition, on **Wednesday November 15th at 5:00pm**. Here are the requirements for this report:

* Provide a description of your hardware.

* Provide a description of the software stack used to perform the experiments.

* From the paper, reproduce **Figure 8** (total communication volume as a function of matrix size,
  for a fixed number of processes), as well as the top plots of **Figures 10 and 12** (performance
  per process and total running time as a function of matrix size, for a fixed number of processes).

  Since your hardware probably does not have P=15 nodes available, you are expected to use a number
  of MPI processes adapted to the scale of your hardware, while being large enough for the
  communication reduction to be meaningful. You should use the version of the SBC distribution that
  is suited to your number of MPI processes: **basic** or **extended**, with the appropriate value of r.

  You do not have to use the same number of processes or the same size of matrices or the same block
  size. All this depends on your machine. Please use something that makes sense for your machine and
  clearly indicate your choices.

  * Provide a description of the experiment(s): the number of MPI processes and their mapping onto
    your hardware, the parameters for the distributions used (2DBC and SBC), any option provided to
    the software stack if applicable, the number of runs for each configuration, the tile size, the
    range of matrix sizes, and any other relevant information.
  * Provide the plots reproducing Figures 8, 10 and 12, with suitable legends and scales on the axis.
  * Provide an interpretation of each figure, and comments on the result of your experiments.

* At the start of the competition (on **Monday November 13th, 7:00pm**), we will release another
  experiment that you will have to do. This will be related to the SCâ€™22 paper. This might or might
  not be a plot present in the paper. We will give precise directions **at 7:00pm on Monday November
  13th**.

* By **5:00pm on Wednesday November 15th**, your report needs to be uploaded on the file server.


Members of the Reproducible Challenge Commitee will visit the teams during the
competition **on Tuesday Monday November 14th from 10:15AM to noon and from
1:30PM to 2:30PM, SCC Booth,** to enquire about your progress, you are expected
to be available to answer their questions.

## Additional requirements for the Reproducibility Challenge

The main content of the Reproducibility Challenge is already known by all the teams;
details of the requirements can be found on the [Discourse server of the challenge](https://discourse.studentclustercompetition.us/)

Additional requirements revealed on the day of the challenge (Monday November 13th 2023, 7:00pm) are presented below. These additional requirements are part of the competition as much as the previous ones. Your findings regarding this new topic and the related experiments should be included in your report and will be evaluated.

**Topic:** symmetric matrix inversion using Cholesky


You are expected to test out different data distributions for the inversion of a symmetric positive definite matrix *A* using Cholesky factorization.

This operation POINV, denoted POINV, is composed of three steps:
(1 - POTRF) a Cholesky factorization of *A = LL^T*; 
(2 - TRTRI) a triangular inversion to compute *L^{-1}*; 
(3 - LAUUM) a symmetric matrix multiplication to compute *A^{-1} = L^{-1}^T L^{-1}*.
Steps (2) and (3) together are referred to as the POTRI operation.


Section 5.F.2 of the paper details the communication scheme associated with the distributed execution of each step of the operation. The communication scheme of step (2) does not show any symmetry that can be taken advantage of using SBC distribution over regular 2DBC. Hence, a strategy based on the redistribution of the tiles of the matrix between each step is presented in the same section: it uses SBC distribution for steps (1) and (3) and 2DBC for step (2).

Formulas for the theoretical volume of communications using 2DBC distribution alone or the redistribution strategy are provided.

The POINV operation as a whole is directly accessible in Chameleon. Besides, it allows to provide a direct option to manage two distinct distributions for the operation via the +CHAMELEON_POINV_REMAP+ environment variable.

Details can be found in the [Chameleon documentation](https://solverstack.gitlabpages.inria.fr/chameleon/dev/group__CHAMELEON__Complex64__t__Tile_gaebb6657aca7f68f07bbf92f7fceed8d7.html#gaebb6657aca7f68f07bbf92f7fceed8d7)

**Requirements**
For this new topic, you are required to:
1. Produce performance and time-to-solution plots similar to Figures 10 and 12 in the paper for the POINV operation as a whole. They must feature experimental results for 2DBC and SBC distributions as well as the redistribution strategy.
2. Generate a plot of the total volume of communications for each distribution, similar to Figure 8. Compare this volume to the value predicted by the theory.
3. Observe the relative performance of each distribution strategy and provide a qualitative interpretation considering the reduction of communications.
